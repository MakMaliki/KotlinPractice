/**
Inheritance Classes can extend other classes and use the extend class methods
or Classes can iherit methods,parameters from super classes


Encapsulation Hidding data and inner working of a class from other class that don't know how something is done

Abstraction : A common feature of 2 classes should be abstract in 3rd class

Polymorphism : Same name different forms


 INHERITANCE Example
 -> Inheritance oop

 Class can inherit variables and methods from super class

 To make class Inheritable we should use Open keyword


 Child class can override method, paramters of parent class using the override keywod but the super class params and methods
 must have open keyword at first



 Encapsulation
-> Encapsulation
Hiding data and inner working of a class from other class that don't know how something is done


 variable and functions available only in the block of code they are declared in

 Classes can change the scope of variable/ functions

 Modifiers :
 private   -> visible inside the class not inheritable
 protected -> visible inside the class and inheriting class
 internal  -> visible inside the package
 public    -> visible to anyone accessing the class

 Default is public


 //Abstraction
 If 2 or more classes share a common feature,
create a super class that contain common features and inherit from it in those classes

Reduce code duplication

we use interface for Abstraction
 The keyword Abstract means that class can't be instantiated but only extend from it

 we can't create a new object of abstract class



 PolyMorphism

 One Name many Forms

 a method , function can do different things in different situations

 2Types
 Dynamic
 Static
